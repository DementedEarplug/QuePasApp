# QuePasApp
Social network application

With this application users will be able to chat with each other through message posts in group chats. Also, users will be able to add other users to their contact lists for future reference when creating a group chat. Reactions for chat messages are possible (like and dislike) and possibly the user could post a message with an image or video. 

## ER Diagram

Our ER Diagram consists of 3 Main Entitities: Users, Group Chats and Messages. Related to these you also have reactions and various other relations between the entities such as: BelongsTo, Creates, Posts

## API Routing

Designing a mockup of what the API implementation could be was important for the development of the backend. Using swaggerhub we were able to prepare the design of the API. [View in this link](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Ykram12/QuePasApp/1.0.0#/)

## Story Map

A projection of the web-applications development was done. Although due to the way phases are delivered we may not follow this story map strictly.
